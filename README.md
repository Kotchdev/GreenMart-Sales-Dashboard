   - Filtered dataset to focus on **2017 transactions only**.
   - Ensured data consistency for categories and subcategories.

2. **Dashboard Design**
   - **Time Analysis**: Monthly sales & profit trends.
   - **Product Analysis**: Category performance, profit by sub-category.

## 🔎 Key Insights & Recommendations

**Key Insights (from the 2017 dataset):**
- **Sales Growth**: Sales steadily increased in 2017, peaking in December — suggesting strong seasonality and end-of-year demand.  
- **Product Profitability**: Technology products drove the most revenue, but Furniture showed weak or negative profit margins in states like Texas and Pennsylvania.  
- **Regional Variation**: California and New York dominated sales, while states in the Midwest underperformed despite similar product availability.  
- **Customer Contribution**: A small group of repeat customers generated a disproportionately large share of revenue.  

**Recommendations:**
- **Target Promotions in Low-Profit States**: Investigate why Furniture underperforms in specific regions — consider adjusting pricing, supply chain costs, or marketing strategy.  
- **Expand High-Performing Categories**: Prioritize Technology category expansion (bundling, upselling accessories) since it consistently delivers revenue.  
- **Customer Retention Strategy**: Build loyalty programs or exclusive offers for repeat customers, who are already driving most of the sales.  
- **Seasonality Planning**: Stock and market aggressively in Q4 (Oct–Dec), as year-end demand shows the highest returns.  
- **Regional Marketing Push**: Allocate more targeted campaigns in the Midwest to capture untapped demand and balance revenue across regions.
